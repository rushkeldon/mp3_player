üåê  [Production](https://appcloud9.com/mp3/)

üåê  Sample MP3 directories at https://gloriouschoice.com/snd/

### WHAT
* A web based MP3 player
* Provide a URL to an apache server with directory listing turned on (note protocols must match)
* Check the 'https' checkbox to change page's protocol to https
* Checking the 'keepAwake' checkbox starts playing a small and blank video file and never lets it reach the end - this is for mobile devices to keep them from sleeping the screen
* Writes cookies to store last URL, last track, and last timecode to restore in subsequent sessions (shaves off 5 seconds of timecode for orientation)
* Previous and Next track buttons
* Clicking on a track starts playing that track

### DEPENDENCIES - RUNTIME
* none - this is a 'vanilla javascript' project

### DEPENDENCIES - DEV TIME
* **LESS** - a CSS preprocessor *"It's CSS, with just a little more."*
